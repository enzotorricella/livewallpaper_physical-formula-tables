# livewallpaper_physical-formula-tables
This project is a website as a wallpaper with the ability to interact and show different physical formulas from different areas. example: Newtonian mechanics, relativity, thermodynamics, etc.  It can be used as a cute wallpaper or as a pedagogical tool for classes explaining concepts or showing physical formulas.

Clarification, all this current code is not mine but was written by Mike Golus, I only adapted it to another related topic and sought to give it more functionalities.
